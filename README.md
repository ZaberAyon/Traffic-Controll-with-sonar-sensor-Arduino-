# Traffic Controll system using sonar sensors 
It is demo project of Controlling traffic lights with the sonar reading and upload it to the server using NODE MCU. 

In this project six sonar sensors is used to control three roads. Every road contains three sets of LED, Red, Yellow and Green . If three roads are free or three roads are equally engaged then the LEDs will glow in a prespacified random pattern. But if One road is busy than other two roads the the busy road will show green LED and the other two will show RED.

The Sonar sensor data of the six sensors is uploaded to the 'www.thinkspeak.com' using node mcu wifi module.
